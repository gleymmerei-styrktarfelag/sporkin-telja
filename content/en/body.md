title: How much should my baby move?

From weeks 18-24 women start to feel the movements of the baby, and the movements increase up to week 32. After that they
stay relatively similar for the rest of the pregnancy.

The baby’s movements are a barometer of its well-being. Each child is unique and therefore it is important for you
to know your baby’s pattern and frequency of movement. Your baby should continue to move regularly
for the duration of your pregnancy.

Sometimes women are told a baby moves less in the third term, but that is NOT true.

Your perception of the fetal movements changes as the due date approches. The character of the movements changes when the pregnancy approaches delivery due to limited space in the uterus, but the frequency and intensity will not normally decrease.

As delivery approches, the uterine contractility increases, which can alter your perceptions of the movements.
